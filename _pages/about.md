I am a PhD student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Leida Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/ldli/), also a visiting PhD student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I obtained the M.Sc. degree in 2021 at the China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, P.R. China, and obtained the B.Sc. degree at the Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, P.R. China, in 2017. My Master Thesis is awarded the Excellent Master's Thesis of Jiangsu Province in 2022, and the Excellent Master's Thesis of CUMT in 2021. I am a Student Member of IEEE/CSIG/CAAI, Journal Reviewers of Neurocomputing and [IET Image Processing](https://yipoh.github.io/files/IETIPR.pdf). My research interests include multimedia quality assessment, computational aesthetics and perceptual image processing.
